This mod rewrites Editor UI in ImGui and adds some new (or not so) features!

This is a <cr>public beta</c> so if you find some bugs, let me know in my [Discord server](http://discord.com/invite/6WGqURwYy4).
I mean, I really just don't know what to say here. The mod is so big, you just need to take a look by yourself lol.

## <c-fbe970>Important Stuff</c>

- <c-8BC81A>Ninkaz's Editor Utils</c> by Ninkaz - Users have been complaining about occasional crashes with this mod, so it's on the list too.
